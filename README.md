Following the basic and advanced [tutorials](https://redux.js.org/) on 

This repo contains a [Babel Node server](https://github.com/babel/example-node-server) to support ES6. Source files go in `src` and are compiled to `dist.` `npm run build` does the transpiling.

Added a folder `egghead` to work on the [Redux tutorials there](https://egghead.io/series/getting-started-with-redux).  The Redux transpiler can be started in this path by running `npm run egg_start` from the `egghead/dist` folder.  The [expect library](https://github.com/mjackson/expect) has also been installed.
